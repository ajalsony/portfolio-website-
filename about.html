      <h2>Hi, I'm Ajal Sony</h2>
      <p>I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Cyber Security at St. Joseph's College of Engineering and Technology, Palai.</p>
      <p>I enjoy writing code, working on interesting projects, and learning new technologies. When I'm not coding, I love playing computer games.</p>
      <p>My interests span across software development, ethical hacking, and building secure systems. I have a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, C, and JavaScript, and I enjoy exploring emerging tech in cybersecurity.</p>
      <p>I am always excited to collaborate with others on tech projects, learn from my peers, and contribute to open-source initiatives. I'm also passionate about creating meaningful solutions that can solve real-world problems.</p>
      <p>Aside from academics and coding, I enjoy strategy games and multiplayer gaming experiences that require teamwork and critical thinking. These hobbies have helped me improve my decision-making and adaptability skills.</p>
